# Molecular Dynamics Simulation

This repository contains an implementation of Molecular Dynamics Simulation to model a Lennard-Jones fluid in the NVE ensemble. 

## Description

The project provides a detailed simulation of a Lennard-Jones fluid using a Molecular Dynamics approach. The fluid is represented within the NVE ensemble, which means the number of particles (N), volume (V), and energy (E) are kept constant throughout the simulation.

## Dataset

The initial (dimensionless) coordinates for a 256-atom liquid system are provided in a cubic simulation cell. The specifics are as follows:

- Number of atoms: 256
- Side length of cubic simulation cell (L): 6.8 (dimensionless)
  
The data for the initial coordinates can be found in the file [`liquid256.txt`](./liquid256.txt).
